Cloud = '''Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources,
  especially data storage which can be cloud
  storage and computing power without direct active management by the user.
 
  Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and typically
  uses a pay as you go model, which can help in reducing capital expenses
  but may also lead to unexpected operating expenses for users.
 
 Cloud computing works by enabling client devices to access data and cloud applications over the
 internet from remote physical servers, databases and computers.
 
 Cloud computing also relies heavily on
 virtualization and automation technologies.
 
 	Public cloud; in this model, a third party cloud service provider delivers the cloud service over the internet.
  Public cloud services are sold on demand typically by the minute or hour hand,
  though long-term commitments are available for many services.

	Hybrid cloud; it is a combination of both the public and the hybrid
 cloud services with orchestration and automation between the two.

 The goal of a hybrid cloud is to create a unified, automated
 and scalable environment that takes advantage of all that a public cloud can provide.'''
